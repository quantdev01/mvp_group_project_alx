            <p class="the-primary-problem">
              The primary problem this pharmacovigilance reporting system
              aims to address is the inefficiency and inaccuracy in the
              current processes of reporting adverse drug reactions (ADRs)
              and medication errors. Traditional methods often involve
              cumbersome paperwork, lack of standardization, and delayed
              reporting, which can hinder timely detection of drug safety
              issues. Additionally, existing systems may not provide
              sufficient confidentiality options, discouraging healthcare
              professionals and patients from reporting sensitive
              information. There is also a gap in integrating preclinical
              safety data with clinical reports, which can limit the
              comprehensiveness of pharmacovigilance efforts.
